class Fridge(dict):
    """
    Fridge is a subclass of :class:`dict` and thus fully conforms to its interface.

    Fridge keeps an open file until it's closed, so you have to call :meth:`close`
    when you're done using it.

    Fridge implements :meth:`__enter__` and :meth:`__exit__` so you can use
    `with` statement.

    :param path: a path to a file that will be used to load and save the data
    :param file: a file object that will be used to load and save the data.
        This file object in not closed by fridge automatically.
    :param dump_args: dictionary of arguments that are passed to :func:`json.dump`.
    :param load_args: dictionary of arguments that are passed to :func:`json.load`.

    `path` and `file` arguments are mutually exclusive.
